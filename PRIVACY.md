# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** February 14, 2026

Spectty is an open-source SSH terminal app for iOS. Your privacy is important to us, so we designed the app to work entirely on your device.

## Data We Collect

None. Spectty does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, usage data, analytics, or telemetry of any kind.

## Network Connections

Spectty only makes network connections that you explicitly initiate by connecting to SSH servers you configure. All SSH connections are established directly between your device and the remote host. No traffic is routed through or intercepted by any intermediary server operated by us.

## Credentials

SSH credentials (hostnames, usernames, passwords, and keys) are stored locally on your device in the iOS Keychain. They never leave your device except as part of the SSH connection you initiate.

## Third-Party Services

Spectty does not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

Spectty does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be posted here with an updated effective date. Since Spectty collects no data, meaningful changes are unlikely.

## Contact

If you have questions about this privacy policy, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ocnc/spectty/issues).
